        <p>Among the religious tourist attractions of Nepal, Uttarbahini Kshetra is a famous, picturesque and legendary
          area.</p>

        <p>Uttarbahini Kshetra is between Malunga Ward No. 1 of Galyang Municipality of Syangja District and Ward No. 1
          of Rambha Rural Municipality of Palpa District.</p>

        <p>Gandaki flows from south to north in the Uttarbahini region. The North direction is the most important in
          SanƒÅtana Dharma. Himalaya Mountains, Mount Kailash, and Vaikuntha Dhams are in the North direction.</p>

        <p>In Vastu Shastra, the land facing north is considered to be the best. The place where holy rivers, which have
          religious significance in themselves, flow through north channels is considered to be the most important
          place.</p>

        <p>The reason why Banaras is the most important on the banks of the Ganges River is that the Ganges flows north
          in Banaras.</p>

        <p>Khadka Shamsher got a chance to know the glory of the Uttarabahini region while travelling to Banaras. After
          he returned to Nepal, there is a history of building the Ranimahal after researching with scholars to find out
          where the Gandaki river turned to the north.</p>

        <p>In geography, the north direction is upwards and the south direction is downwards. It is the nature of a
          river to flow from the mountains above i.e. north to the sea below i.e. south, but the situation where the
          river turns 360 degrees i.e. completely to the north is extremely rare. The place where the river returns to
          its source i.e. towards Maitighar is considered to be the most sacred and auspicious place.</p>

        <p>Therefore, where the river turns to the north, there is a throng of devout pilgrims, fairs are held and
          devotees come from far and wide with deep faith in their hearts to perform the deity work.</p>

        <p>As the river turns northward in areas such as Gokarna, Betravati in Nepal and Varanasi in India, it has
          become the beloved region of many incarnations of God and the centre of faith of the people.</p>

        <p>The direction of magnetic field lines within the magnet is from south to north.</p>


        <p class="mb-5">The word Uttar in Nepali is not only a directional word but also a solution word. Thus,
          returning to the North means from the problem to the solution, from the question to the answer. In other
          words, the solution to all the problems of the world is found in Uttarabahini.</p>
