<p>As described in Nardiya Purana, the son of Mrikandu sage, Markandeya, was born in Uttarbahini Kshetra, and according
    to Ananda Ramayana, Lord Rama rescued 16 thousand penance girls here and gave them the boon of making them his queen
    during the next incarnation (Krishna). A cursed Vidyadhar was also rescued by Lord Rama here.</p>

<p>In this way, it can be understood that Uttarbahini Kshetra is the Tapasthali and Lilasthali of the 16 thousand queens
    of Shri Krishna, who were 16 thousand young girls in their previous birth, Mrikandu, Markandeya, and Lord Rama.</p>

<p>The fact that, in Uttarbahini Kshetra, Sage Markandeya achieved victory over death through sadhana can also be
    understood as it being the most enigmatic and horryfying death-defeating place of the world. Since 16,000 girls have
    attained God as their husband as per their wishes by doing penance here, that makes this area the perfect place to
    have world's positive wishes fulfilled.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Chakrashila</h2>

<p>A wonderful miraculous stone, called Chakrashila, can also be seen here now. Some people worship it as Vishnupadaka,
    some as Shivlinga, some as Shaalgrama, while some worship it as Kalika Swaroop and some as Chakravarti
    Lakshminarayan Swaroop. The stone is actually engraved with Sudarshan Chakras and one can directly see OM written in
    a natural form in clear and beautiful letters as if painted in the middle. This Chakrashila is one of the major
    scenic spots of Uttarbahini Kshetra. Shila is located under an old Java plum tree but surprisingly self-generated
    Var, Pipal and Swami can also be seen here.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Shankhe Pipal</h2>

<p>Another attraction of Uttarbahini Kshetra is Shankhe Pipal. Producing sound of conch shells from time to time,
    Shankhe Pipal is a spectacular tree of the region. At present, there are 108 Pipals around the Shankhe Pipal and
    another Sudarshan Chakrashila is also placed in this premises. Sometimes in the middle of the night one can hear the
    sounds of the long conch sound from this conch people. So far, no scientific research has been done as to why the
    conch sound is heard from this tree.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Projects of today and beyond</h2>

<p>A natural hospital, Himalaya, cave and 108 Mukti Dharas are being constructed in Uttarbahini Kshetra. Also, modern
    Gurukul is being operated. The work of creating a suitable environment for training in various forms of Sanatan
    Dharma, including yoga and meditation, is underway. Let's awaken the potential of this most beautiful region and
    work together to make the country prosperous.</p>
